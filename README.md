for windows run:
```bash
cmd.exe /c run_experiments.bat
```

for linux run:
```bash
chmod +x run_experiments.sh and ./run_experiments.sh
 ```
The any current work in bash is then saved in results. After running the above we have our first results.  We rename said results. results->statistics. Then we run:

then :
```bash
python test_stats.py
```
Again the results are saved in results. Then passed to notebook to compare with other hyperparemeter runs
